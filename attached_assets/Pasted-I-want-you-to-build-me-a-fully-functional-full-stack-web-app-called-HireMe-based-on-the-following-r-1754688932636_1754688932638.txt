I want you to build me a fully functional full-stack web app called HireMe, based on the following requirements. This is not a skeleton — make it production-ready and working end-to-end.

App Concept: HireMe is an AI-powered platform for startups and entrepreneurs that acts like an “AI employee,” helping in coding, design, marketing, product management, analysis, and more. It should have a modern, clean UI inspired by the Wise money transfer app theme.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (with Vite or CRA), TailwindCSS or styled-components for styling.

Backend: Node.js + Express.

Database: Use a simple JSON file or SQLite for data persistence (so it runs in Replit without external DB). Make sure the DB logic is implemented so I can replace it with MongoDB later.

API Calls: Integrate OpenAI or HuggingFace API for AI chat/assistant features.

Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

Core Features:

Landing Page – Clean hero section, “About HireMe”, “How it works”, “Contact Us”.

User Authentication – Sign up, Login, Logout (JWT-based).

Dashboard –

Personalized AI assistant chat (integrated with OpenAI/HuggingFace API).

Different “modes” for assistance: Coding, Design, Marketing, Product Management, Analysis.

Users can send queries and get AI-generated answers in real time.

Projects Section – Users can create, view, and delete “project” entries with AI notes.

Search Functionality – Working search bar in dashboard that instantly returns relevant projects or AI resources.

Admin Mode – A separate admin login that can view all users and their projects.

UI Requirements:

Layout and components must be well-aligned, no broken styling.

Color scheme & design similar to Wise app – modern, clean, white space, blue/green accent colors, rounded cards, soft shadows.

Make sure all components are visible on all screen sizes (fix alignment issues).

Functionality Requirements:

AI chat must be working (not placeholder text).

Search must return results from existing stored projects.

Authentication must actually work.

All CRUD operations for projects must work.

Output Requirements:

Give me the complete code (frontend + backend) in one Replit project.

Ensure I can export the code and push it to GitHub.

Ensure the app runs locally (npm install && npm run dev or similar) and can be deployed to Vercel after exporting.

Include a README file with instructions.

Build this exactly as described, fully working, no placeholders.

If you paste this into Replit AI, it will try to give you a working project instead of a half-baked skeleton, and you’ll be able to:

Export it → GitHub → Deploy on Vercel.

Use it in interviews as your own project.

Keep all the code for learning.
